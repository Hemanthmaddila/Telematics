2. Open terminal/command prompt
3. Run: `aws configure`
4. Enter your:
   - AWS Access Key ID
   - AWS Secret Access Key
   - Default region (e.g., us-east-1)
   - Default output format (json)

### Step 2: Docker Installation
1. Download Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Install and start Docker
3. Verify installation: `docker --version`

### Step 3: Git Setup
1. Download Git from https://git-scm.com/
2. Install Git
3. Configure Git:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

### Step 4: Python Environment
1. Download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install Python 3.8 or higher
3. Verify installation: `python --version`

## What You'll Do During Implementation

### Day 1: Foundation Setup
1. **Run AWS CLI configuration** with your credentials
2. **Verify account permissions** to create resources
3. **Monitor infrastructure creation** progress
4. **Review and approve** VPC and networking setup

### Day 2: Service Deployment
1. **Build Docker images** locally (commands provided)
2. **Push images to ECR** (commands provided)
3. **Monitor service deployment** status
4. **Test service endpoints** once deployed

### Day 3: Data and Monitoring
1. **Upload initial data** to S3 buckets (commands provided)
2. **Verify data pipeline** processing
3. **Review monitoring dashboards** in CloudWatch
4. **Test alert notifications**

### Day 4: Automation and Security
1. **Set up GitHub repository** for CI/CD
2. **Configure GitHub Actions** secrets
3. **Review security policies** and permissions
4. **Test backup and recovery** procedures

## Commands You'll Run

### AWS CLI Commands
```bash
# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure

# Verify configuration
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Check region and account
aws ec2 describe-availability-zones --output text --query 'AvailabilityZones[0].[RegionName]'
```

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Build images (provided by system)
docker build -t telematics/risk-service -f microservices/risk-service/Dockerfile.cloud .

# Push to ECR (provided by system)
docker push [your-account-id].dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/telematics/risk-service:latest
```

### Git Commands
```bash
# Clone repository (provided by system)
git clone [repository-url]

# Push changes (provided by system)
git add .
git commit -m "Deployment updates"
git push origin main
```

## Monitoring and Validation

### What to Monitor
1. **AWS Console**: Watch resource creation in EC2, RDS, S3 dashboards
2. **Service Health**: Check ECS service status and task health
3. **Data Flow**: Monitor S3 data uploads and processing
4. **Alerts**: Verify CloudWatch alarms and notifications

### Success Indicators
1. **ECS Cluster**: All services running with healthy status
2. **Load Balancer**: Health checks passing for all services
3. **Database**: Connected and accepting queries
4. **S3**: Data flowing through buckets correctly
5. **Monitoring**: Metrics and logs appearing in CloudWatch
6. **CI/CD**: Automated deployments working on code changes

## Troubleshooting Your Responsibility

### Common Issues You Might Encounter
1. **AWS CLI Authentication**: Ensure credentials are correct
2. **Docker Build Issues**: Check Dockerfile syntax and dependencies
3. **Network Connectivity**: Verify security groups and VPC settings
4. **Permission Errors**: Check IAM roles and policies

### When to Contact Support
1. **Resource Limits**: If you hit AWS free tier limits
2. **Persistent Errors**: If services fail to deploy after multiple attempts
3. **Security Concerns**: If you notice unauthorized access attempts
4. **Billing Questions**: If you have questions about costs

## What You DON'T Need to Do

The following will be handled automatically by the system:

1. **Write any code** - All code is provided
2. **Create Dockerfiles** - All Dockerfiles are created
3. **Write Terraform scripts** - Infrastructure as code is provided
4. **Configure CloudWatch dashboards** - Monitoring setup is automated
5. **Set up CI/CD pipelines** - GitHub Actions workflows are created
6. **Manage IAM policies** - Security configurations are automated
7. **Deploy services** - Deployment scripts are provided
8. **Create databases** - Database setup is automated
