## Tutorials

The `tutorials` directory contains comprehensive guides for deploying the system to the cloud:

1. **01_cloud_infrastructure_setup.md** - Setting up basic cloud infrastructure (VPC, networking, databases)
2. **02_containerizing_and_deploying_services.md** - Containerizing services and deploying to ECS
3. **03_data_storage_and_processing.md** - Data storage, processing pipelines, and analytics
4. **04_monitoring_logging_observability.md** - Monitoring, logging, and alerting setup
5. **05_ci_cd_and_automation.md** - CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code
6. **06_security_and_compliance.md** - Security best practices and compliance measures

## Quick Start

1. Review the `COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for an overview
2. Follow the tutorials in order, starting with `tutorials/01_cloud_infrastructure_setup.md`
3. Set up your AWS account and CLI credentials
4. Proceed through each day of the implementation plan

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- AWS CLI configured
- Docker installed
- Python 3.8+
- Git

## Deployment Timeline

The system can be deployed in 4 days following the tutorial guides:

- **Day 1**: Infrastructure setup
- **Day 2**: Service deployment
- **Day 3**: Data processing and monitoring
- **Day 4**: Automation and security

## Security and Compliance

The system includes:
- IAM roles and policies
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR and SOC2 compliance features
- Security monitoring and incident response

## Cost Considerations

Designed to stay within AWS Free Tier limits:
- EC2 (t3.micro instances)
- RDS (db.t3.micro)
- S3 (5GB storage)
- CloudWatch (basic monitoring)
