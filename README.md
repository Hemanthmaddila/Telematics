## üìã **PROBLEM STATEMENT**

Traditional automobile insurance pricing relies on generalized demographic factors that fail to reflect actual driving behavior, resulting in unfair premiums and limited incentives for safer driving. This project develops a **telematics-based auto insurance solution** that accurately captures real-time driving behavior and vehicle usage data, integrating it into a dynamic insurance pricing model to enable fairer, usage-based insurance (UBI) with Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) and Pay-How-You-Drive (PHYD) capabilities.

## ‚ö° **QUICK EVALUATION - 5 MINUTES**

### **STEP 1: Test Live System Health**
```bash
# Check system status (should return "healthy")
curl http://telematics-alb-1568825282.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/health

# Check all microservices (should show 6 services running)
curl http://telematics-alb-1568825282.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/services/status
```

### **STEP 2: Test Complete Pipeline**
```bash
# 1. Create a trip (tests data collection & processing)
curl -X POST http://telematics-alb-1568825282.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/trips \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "driver_id": "assessor_test_001",
    "trip_data": {
      "distance_miles": 25.3,
      "duration_minutes": 45,
      "hard_brakes": 2,
      "rapid_accels": 1,
      "max_speed_mph": 68,
      "phone_usage_seconds": 45
    }
  }'

# 2. Test risk assessment (tests ML model)
curl -X POST http://telematics-alb-1568825282.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/risk/assess \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "driver_id": "assessor_test_001",
    "trip_data": {
      "hard_brakes": 2,
      "rapid_accels": 1,
      "max_speed_mph": 68,
      "phone_usage_seconds": 45,
      "distance_miles": 25.3
    }
  }'

# 3. Test dynamic pricing (tests pricing engine)
curl -X POST http://telematics-alb-1568825282.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/pricing/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "driver_id": "assessor_test_001",
    "risk_score": 35.5,
    "base_premium": 150.0
  }'
```

### **STEP 3: View Dashboard**
Open browser: http://telematics-alb-1568825282.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/dashboard

**You should see:**
- Driver profiles with risk scores
- Trip history and analytics
- Dynamic pricing with discounts/surcharges
- Real-time behavioral feedback
- Gamification elements (badges, points)
