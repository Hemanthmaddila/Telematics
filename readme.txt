PROBLEM STATEMENT
=================================================================

Traditional automobile insurance pricing relies on generalized demographic factors 
that fail to reflect actual driving behavior, resulting in unfair premiums and 
limited incentives for safer driving. This project develops a telematics-based 
auto insurance solution that accurately captures real-time driving behavior and 
vehicle usage data, integrating it into a dynamic insurance pricing model to 
enable fairer, usage-based insurance (UBI) with Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD) and 
Pay-How-You-Drive (PHYD) capabilities.
