# ðŸ“Š Telematics Data Strategy & Master Feature Set

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive data strategy for building a production-grade telematics insurance risk assessment system. Based on extensive industry research and analysis of leading insurance carriers (Progressive, State Farm, GEICO, USAA), we've designed a unified approach that handles both smartphone-only and device-augmented users through a single, sophisticated machine learning model.

## Core Principle: Unified Data Architecture

Our system operates on the principle of **"One App, Two Data Sources"** - the smartphone app serves as the universal hub for all users, with optional augmentation from OBD-II devices for enhanced data quality.

### User Types Supported

#### Type 1: Phone-Only Users
- **Data Source**: Smartphone app using internal sensors (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope)
- **Coverage**: All behavioral features, phone usage patterns, contextual data
- **Limitations**: No vehicle system data, slightly lower GPS accuracy
- **Market Share**: ~60-70% of telematics users

#### Type 2: Phone + Device Users  
- **Data Source**: Smartphone app + OBD-II device via Bluetooth
- **Coverage**: All features with enhanced vehicle system data
- **Advantages**: Higher accuracy, vehicle health data, fraud prevention
- **Market Share**: ~30-40% of telematics users (growing)

## The Master Feature Set (32 Variables)

Our machine learning model uses 32 carefully selected features that represent the gold standard in telematics risk assessment:

avg_jerk_rate              - Smoothness of driving (rate of acceleration change)
```

### 2. Behavioral Event Features (6 variables)

driver_passenger_confidence_score - Confidence user was driving (0.0-1.0)
```

## Smart Defaults Strategy

The key to our unified model is the **Smart Defaults** approach for handling missing data:

### For Phone-Only Users:
```python
# Vehicle system features are imputed with neutral defaults
avg_engine_rpm = 2200                    # Population average for safe drivers
has_dtc_codes = 0                        # Assume no diagnostic codes
airbag_deployment_flag = 0               # No crash detection available
data_source = "phone_only"              # Flag for model interpretation
```

### For Phone + Device Users:
```python
# All features populated with real device data
avg_engine_rpm = actual_rpm_from_obd     # Real engine data
has_dtc_codes = obd_diagnostic_status    # Actual vehicle health
airbag_deployment_flag = crash_sensor    # Real crash detection
data_source = "phone_plus_device"       # Flag for enhanced data
```

# Claim probability simulation logic:
def calculate_claim_probability(features):
    base_risk = 0.02  # 2% baseline monthly claim rate
    
    # Behavioral risk multipliers
    base_risk += features['hard_brake_rate'] * 0.005
    base_risk += features['speeding_rate'] * 0.003  
    base_risk += features['phone_usage_pct'] * 0.004
    base_risk += features['night_driving_pct'] * 0.002
    
    # Contextual adjustments
    if features['rain_driving_pct'] > 0.3:
        base_risk *= 1.2  # 20% increase for weather exposure
        
    # Experience factors
    base_risk += features['prior_accidents'] * 0.01
    
    return min(0.5, base_risk)  # Cap at 50% monthly probability
